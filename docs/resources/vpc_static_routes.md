resource "nsxt_vpc_static_route" "test" {
  context {
    project_id = data.nsxt_policy_project.demoproj.id
    vpc_id     = data.nsxt_vpc.demovpc.id
  }

  display_name = "test"
  description  = "Terraform provisioned StaticRoutes"

  network = "3.3.3.0/24"

  next_hop {
    ip_address     = "10.230.3.1"
    admin_distance = 4
  }
}
```
