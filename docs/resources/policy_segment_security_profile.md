# nsxt_policy_segment_security_profile

This resource provides a method for the management of a Segment Security Profile.

This resource is applicable to NSX Global Manager, NSX Policy Manager and VMC.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "nsxt_policy_segment_security_profile" "test" {
  display_name                 = "test"
  description                  = "Terraform provisioned Segment Security Profile"
  bpdu_filter_allow            = ["01:80:c2:00:00:05"]
  bpdu_filter_enable           = true
  dhcp_client_block_enabled    = true
  dhcp_client_block_v6_enabled = true
  dhcp_server_block_enabled    = false
  dhcp_server_block_v6_enabled = true
  non_ip_traffic_block_enabled = true
  ra_guard_enabled             = true
  rate_limits_enabled          = true

  rate_limit {
    rx_broadcast = 1800
  }
}
```

## Example Usage - Multi-Tenancy

```hcl
data "nsxt_policy_project" "demoproj" {
  display_name = "demoproj"
}

resource "nsxt_policy_segment_security_profile" "test" {
  context {
    project_id = data.nsxt_policy_project.demoproj.id
  }
  display_name                 = "test"
  description                  = "Terraform provisioned Segment Security Profile"
  bpdu_filter_allow            = ["01:80:c2:00:00:05"]
  bpdu_filter_enable           = true
  dhcp_client_block_enabled    = true
  dhcp_client_block_v6_enabled = true
  dhcp_server_block_enabled    = false
  dhcp_server_block_v6_enabled = true
  non_ip_traffic_block_enabled = true
  ra_guard_enabled             = true
  rate_limits_enabled          = true

  rate_limit {
    rx_broadcast = 1800
  }
}
```

## Attributes Reference

In addition to arguments listed above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the resource.
* `revision` - Indicates current revision number of the object as seen by NSX-T API server. This attribute can be useful for debugging.
* `path` - The NSX path of the policy resource.

## Importing

An existing object can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource, via the following command:

[docs-import]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import

```shell
terraform import nsxt_policy_segment_security_profile.test UUID
```

The above command imports Segment Security Profile named `test` with the NSX ID `UUID`.

```shell
terraform import nsxt_policy_segment_security_profile.test POLICY_PATH
```

The above command imports Segment Security Profile named `test` with the policy path `POLICY_PATH`.
Note: for multitenancy projects only the later form is usable.
