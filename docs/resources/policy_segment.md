# nsxt_policy_segment

This resource provides a method for the management of Segments.

This resource is applicable to NSX Global Manager, NSX Policy Manager and VMC.

~> **NOTE:** For best user experience, it is recommended to use `nsxt_policy_fixed_segment` resource on VMC. Flexible segments and not supported in early versions of VMC UI.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "nsxt_policy_segment" "segment1" {
  display_name        = "segment1"
  description         = "Terraform provisioned Segment"
  transport_zone_path = data.nsxt_policy_transport_zone.tz1.path

}
```

## Example Usage - Multi-Tenancy

```hcl
data "nsxt_policy_project" "demoproj" {
  display_name = "demoproj"
}

resource "nsxt_policy_segment" "segment1" {
  context {
    project_id = data.nsxt_policy_project.demoproj.id
  }
  display_name      = "segment1"
  description       = "Terraform provisioned Segment"
  connectivity_path = data.nsxt_policy_tier1_gateway.tier1_gw.path

  subnet {
    cidr        = "12.12.2.1/24"
    dhcp_ranges = ["12.12.2.100-12.12.2.160"]

    dhcp_v4_config {
      server_address = "12.12.2.2/24"
      lease_time     = 36000

      dhcp_option_121 {
        network  = "6.6.6.0/24"
        next_hop = "1.1.1.21"
      }

      dhcp_generic_option {
        code   = "119"
        values = ["abc"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Usage with VCD network

```hcl
resource "nsxt_policy_segment" "segment1" {
  display_name        = "external"
  transport_zone_path = data.nsxt_policy_transport_zone.tz1.path

  subnet {
    cidr = "10.240.12.1/24"
  }

  ignore_tags {
    scopes = ["SYSTEM"]
  }

}
```

## Attributes Reference

In addition to arguments listed above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the Security Policy.
* `revision` - Indicates current revision number of the object as seen by NSX-T API server. This attribute can be useful for debugging.

## Importing

An existing segment can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource, via the following command:

[docs-import]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import

```shell
terraform import nsxt_policy_segment.segment1 ID
```

The above command imports the segment  named `segment1` with the NSX Segment ID `ID`.

```shell
terraform import nsxt_policy_segment.segment1 POLICY_PATH
```

The above command imports the segment  named `segment1` with the policy path `POLICY_PATH`.
Note: for multitenancy projects only the later form is usable.

~> **NOTE:** Only flexible (infra) segments can be imported here. To import fixed segment, please use `nsxt_policy_fixed_segment` resource.

~> **NOTE:** Please make sure `advanced_config` clause is present in configuration if you with to include it in import, otherwise it will be ignored with NSX 3.2 onwards. This is due to a platform change in handling advanced config in the API.
