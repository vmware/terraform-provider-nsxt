# nsxt_policy_gateway_policy

This resource provides a method for the management of a Gateway Policy and its Rules.

This resource is applicable to NSX Global Manager and NSX Policy Manager.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "nsxt_policy_gateway_policy" "test" {
  display_name    = "tf-gw-policy"
  description     = "Terraform provisioned Gateway Policy"
  category        = "LocalGatewayRules"
  locked          = false
  sequence_number = 3
  stateful        = true
  tcp_strict      = false

  tag {
    scope = "color"
    tag   = "orange"
  }

  rule {
    display_name       = "rule1"
    destination_groups = [nsxt_policy_group.group1.path, nsxt_policy_group.group2.path]
    disabled           = true
    action             = "DROP"
    logged             = true
    scope              = [nsxt_policy_tier1_gateway.policygateway.path]
  }

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

## Example Usage with Global Manager

```hcl
resource "nsxt_policy_domain" "france" {
  display_name = "France"
  sites        = ["Paris"]
}

resource "nsxt_policy_gateway_policy" "test" {
  display_name    = "tf-gw-policy"
  description     = "Terraform provisioned Gateway Policy"
  domain          = nsxt_policy_domain.france.id
  category        = "LocalGatewayRules"
  locked          = false
  sequence_number = 3
  stateful        = true
  tcp_strict      = false

  tag {
    scope = "color"
    tag   = "orange"
  }

  rule {
    display_name       = "rule1"
    destination_groups = [nsxt_policy_group.group1.path, nsxt_policy_group.group2.path]
    disabled           = true
    action             = "DROP"
    logged             = true
    scope              = [nsxt_policy_tier1_gateway.policygateway.path]
  }

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

## Example Usage - Multi-Tenancy

```hcl
data "nsxt_policy_project" "demoproj" {
  display_name = "demoproj"
}

resource "nsxt_policy_gateway_policy" "test" {
  context {
    project_id = data.nsxt_policy_project.demoproj.id
  }
  display_name    = "tf-gw-policy"
  description     = "Terraform provisioned Gateway Policy"
  category        = "LocalGatewayRules"
  locked          = false
  sequence_number = 3
  stateful        = true
  tcp_strict      = false

  tag {
    scope = "color"
    tag   = "orange"
  }

  rule {
    display_name       = "rule1"
    destination_groups = [nsxt_policy_group.group1.path, nsxt_policy_group.group2.path]
    disabled           = true
    action             = "DROP"
    logged             = true
    scope              = [nsxt_policy_tier1_gateway.policygateway.path]
  }

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

-> We recommend using `lifecycle` directive as in samples above, in order to avoid dependency issues when updating groups/services simultaneously with the rule.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

    * `action` - (Optional) The action for the Rule. Must be one of: `ALLOW`, `DROP` or `REJECT`. Defaults to `ALLOW`.
    * `sequence_number` - (Optional) It is recommended not to specify sequence number for rules, but rather rely on provider to auto-assign them. If you choose to specify sequence numbers, you must make sure the numbers are consistent with order of the rules in configuration. Please note that sequence numbers should start with 1, not 0. To avoid confusion, either specify sequence numbers in all rules, or none at all.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to arguments listed above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the Security Policy.
* `revision` - Indicates current revision number of the object as seen by NSX-T API server. This attribute can be useful for debugging.
* `path` - The NSX path of the policy resource.
* `rule`:
    * `revision` - Indicates current revision number of the object as seen by NSX-T API server. This attribute can be useful for debugging.
    * `path` - The NSX path of the policy resource.
    * `sequence_number` - Sequence number for the rule.
    * `rule_id` - Unique positive number that is assigned by the system and is useful for debugging.

~> **NOTE:** `display_name` argument for service entries is not supported for NSX 3.2.x and below.

## Importing

An existing Gateway Policy can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource, via the following command:

[docs-import]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import

```shell
terraform import nsxt_policy_gateway_policy.gwpolicy1 ID
```

The above command imports the policy Gateway Policy named `gwpolicy1` with the NSX Policy id `ID`.

If the Policy to import isn't in the `default` domain, the domain name can be added to the `ID` before a slash.

For example to import a Group with `ID` in the `MyDomain` domain:

```shell
terraform import nsxt_policy_gateway_policy.gwpolicy1 MyDomain/ID
```
