# Terraform Provider for NSX-T extension for Federation

The NSX Terraform Resources and Data Sources are now extended to support Federation (Global Manager). More information on Federation that was introduced in NSX-T 3.0 can be found on the [NSX-T Product Page for Federation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.0/administration/GUID-D5B6DC79-6733-44A7-8072-50221CF2122A.html)

Documentation on the NSX platform can be found on the [NSX Documentation Page](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/index.html)

## Basic Authentication with Federation

```hcl
provider "nsxt" {
  host           = "192.168.110.41"
  username       = "admin"
  password       = "default"
  global_manager = true
}
```

**NOTE:** Authentication with the Global Manager uses the same NSX-T Terraform provider but uses a `global_manager = true` flag for identification.

**NOTE:** In order to use both Global Manager and Local Manager within same configuration, please use [Provider Aliasing] (<https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#alias-multiple-provider-configurations>).

## Using Resources and Data Sources

Just like authentication, the resources and data sources are same for the Local Manager (LM) and Global Manager (GM). However, there could be small differences in the attributes for each of the objects. These differences, when applicable, are called out in the documentation.

For example, consider the resource nsxt_policy_tier0_gateway. While the same resource works for both GM and LM, when using with GM, the attribute `locale_service` is required, while not applicable for LM (`edge_cluster_path` attribute is used instead).

Remember to check out the documentation for the resource you are interested in for such differences.

**NOTE:** Only Policy resources are available to use with Federation.
