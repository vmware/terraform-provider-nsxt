# nsxt_policy_security_policy_rule

This resource provides a method for the management of Security Policy Rule.

Note: to avoid unexpected behavior, don't use this resource and resource `nsxt_policy_security_policy` to manage rules under a security policy at the same time.
Instead, please use this resource with resource `nsxt_policy_parent_security_policy` to manage a security policy and its rules separately, and use `nsxt_policy_security_policy` to manage a security policy and its rules in one single resource.

This resource is applicable to NSX Global Manager, NSX Policy Manager and VMC.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "nsxt_policy_security_policy_rule" "rule1" {
  display_name       = "rule1"
  description        = "Terraform provisioned Security Policy Rule"
  policy_path        = nsxt_policy_parent_security_policy.policy1.path
  sequence_number    = 1
  destination_groups = [nsxt_policy_group.cats.path, nsxt_policy_group.dogs.path]
  action             = "DROP"
  services           = [nsxt_policy_service.icmp.path]
  logged             = true
}
```

## Example Usage - Multi-Tenancy

```hcl
resource "nsxt_policy_security_policy_rule" "rule1" {
  display_name       = "rule1"
  description        = "Terraform provisioned Security Policy Rule"
  policy_path        = nsxt_policy_parent_security_policy.policy1.path # Path of a multi-tenancy policy
  sequence_number    = 1
  destination_groups = [nsxt_policy_group.cats.path, nsxt_policy_group.dogs.path]
  action             = "DROP"
  services           = [nsxt_policy_service.icmp.path]
  logged             = true
}
```

## Attributes Reference

In addition to arguments listed above, the following attributes are exported:

* `revision` - Indicates current revision number of the object as seen by NSX-T API server. This attribute can be useful for debugging.
* `path` - The NSX path of the policy resource.
* `rule_id` - Unique positive number that is assigned by the system and is useful for debugging.

~> **NOTE:** `display_name` argument for service entries is not supported for NSX 3.2.x and below.

## Importing

An existing security policy can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource, via the following command:

[docs-import]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import

```shell
terraform import nsxt_policy_security_policy_rule.rule1 POLICY_PATH
```

The above command imports the security policy rule named `rule1` with policy path `POLICY_PATH`.
