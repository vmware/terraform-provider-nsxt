# nsxt_policy_parent_security_policy

This resource provides a method for the management of Security Policy without rules.

Note: to avoid unexpected behavior, don't use this resource and resource `nsxt_policy_security_policy` to manage the same Security Policy at the same time.
To config rules under this resource, please use resource `nsxt_policy_security_policy_rule` to manage rules separately.

This resource is applicable to NSX Global Manager, NSX Policy Manager and VMC.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "nsxt_policy_parent_security_policy" "policy1" {
  display_name = "policy1"
  description  = "Terraform provisioned Security Policy"
  category     = "Application"
  locked       = false
  stateful     = true
  tcp_strict   = false
  scope        = [nsxt_policy_group.pets.path]

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "nsxt_policy_security_policy_rule" "rule1" {
  display_name       = "rule1"
  description        = "Terraform provisioned Security Policy Rule"
  policy_path        = nsxt_policy_parent_security_policy.policy1.path
  sequence_number    = 1
  destination_groups = [nsxt_policy_group.cats.path, nsxt_policy_group.dogs.path]
  action             = "DROP"
  services           = [nsxt_policy_service.icmp.path]
  logged             = true
}
```

## Global Manager example

```hcl
data "nsxt_policy_site" "paris" {
  display_name = "Paris"
}
resource "nsxt_policy_parent_security_policy" "policy1" {
  display_name = "policy1"
  description  = "Terraform provisioned Security Policy"
  category     = "Application"
  locked       = false
  stateful     = true
  tcp_strict   = false
  scope        = [nsxt_policy_group.pets.path]
  domain       = data.nsxt_policy_site.paris.id

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "nsxt_policy_security_policy_rule" "rule1" {
  display_name       = "rule1"
  description        = "Terraform provisioned Security Policy Rule"
  policy_path        = nsxt_policy_parent_security_policy.policy1.path
  sequence_number    = 1
  destination_groups = [nsxt_policy_group.cats.path, nsxt_policy_group.dogs.path]
  action             = "DROP"
  services           = [nsxt_policy_service.icmp.path]
  logged             = true
}
```

## Example Usage - Multi-Tenancy

```hcl
data "nsxt_policy_project" "demoproj" {
  display_name = "demoproj"
}

resource "nsxt_policy_parent_security_policy" "policy1" {
  context {
    project_id = data.nsxt_policy_project.demoproj.id
  }
  display_name = "policy1"
  description  = "Terraform provisioned Security Policy"
  category     = "Application"
  locked       = false
  stateful     = true
  tcp_strict   = false
  scope        = [nsxt_policy_group.pets.path]

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}

resource "nsxt_policy_security_policy_rule" "rule1" {
  display_name       = "rule1"
  description        = "Terraform provisioned Security Policy Rule"
  policy_path        = nsxt_policy_parent_security_policy.policy1.path
  sequence_number    = 1
  destination_groups = [nsxt_policy_group.cats.path, nsxt_policy_group.dogs.path]
  action             = "DROP"
  services           = [nsxt_policy_service.icmp.path]
  logged             = true
}
```

-> We recommend using `lifecycle` directive as in samples above, in order to avoid dependency issues when updating groups/services simultaneously with the rule.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `display_name` - (Required) Display name of the resource.
* `description` - (Optional) Description of the resource.
* `domain` - (Optional) The domain to use for the resource. This domain must already exist. For VMware Cloud on AWS use `cgw`. For Global Manager, please use site id for this field. If not specified, this field is default to `default`.
* `tag` - (Optional) A list of scope + tag pairs to associate with this policy.
* `nsx_id` - (Optional) The NSX ID of this resource. If set, this ID will be used to create the resource.
* `context` - (Optional) The context which the object belongs to
    * `project_id` - (Required) The ID of the project which the object belongs to
* `category` - (Required) Category of this policy. For local manager must be one of `Ethernet`, `Emergency`, `Infrastructure`, `Environment`, `Application`. For global manager must be one of: `Infrastructure`, `Environment`, `Application`.
* `comments` - (Optional) Comments for security policy lock/unlock.
* `locked` - (Optional) Indicates whether a security policy should be locked. If locked by a user, no other user would be able to modify this policy.
* `scope` - (Optional) The list of policy object paths where the rules in this policy will get applied.
* `sequence_number` - (Optional) This field is used to resolve conflicts between security policies across domains.
* `stateful` - (Optional) If true, state of the network connects are tracked and a stateful packet inspection is performed. Default is true.
* `tcp_strict` - (Optional) Ensures that a 3 way TCP handshake is done before the data packets are sent. Default is false.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to arguments listed above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the Security Policy.
* `revision` - Indicates current revision number of the object as seen by NSX-T API server. This attribute can be useful for debugging.
* `path` - The NSX path of the policy resource.

## Importing

An existing security policy can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource, via the following command:

[docs-import]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import

```shell
terraform import nsxt_policy_parent_security_policy.policy1 domain/ID
```

The above command imports the security policy named `policy1` under NSX domain `domain` with the NSX Policy ID `ID`.
