# nsxt_logical_tier0_router

This data source provides information about Tier 0 Logical Routers configured in NSX. A Tier 0 router is used to connect NSX networking with traditional physical networking. Tier 0 routers are placed on an Edge cluster and will exist on one or more Edge node depending on deployment settings (i.e. active/active or active/passive). A Tier 0 router forwards layer 3 IP packets and typically peers with a traditional physical router using BGP or can use static routing.

```hcl
data "nsxt_logical_tier0_router" "tier0_router" {
  display_name = "PLR1"
}
```
