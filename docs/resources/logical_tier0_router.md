# nsxt_logical_tier0_router

This resource provides a method for the management of a tier 0 logical router.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "nsxt_logical_tier0_router" "tier0_router" {
  display_name           = "RTR"
  description            = "ACTIVE-STANDBY Tier0 router provisioned by Terraform"
  high_availability_mode = "ACTIVE_STANDBY"
  edge_cluster_id        = data.nsxt_edge_cluster.edge_cluster.id

  tag {
    scope = "color"
    tag   = "blue"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `display_name` - (Optional) Display name, defaults to ID if not set.
* `description` - (Optional) Description of the resource.
* `edge_cluster_id` - (Required) Edge Cluster ID for the logical Tier0 router. Changing this setting on existing router will re-create the router.
* `failover_mode` - (Optional) Failover mode which determines whether the preferred service router instance for given logical router will preempt the peer. Accepted values are PREEMPTIVE/NON_PREEMPTIVE. This setting is relevant only for ACTIVE_STANDBY high availability mode.
* `tag` - (Optional) A list of scope + tag pairs to associate with this logical Tier0 router.
* `high_availability_mode` - (Optional) High availability mode "ACTIVE_ACTIVE"/"ACTIVE_STANDBY". Changing this setting on existing router will re-create the router.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to arguments listed above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the logical Tier0 router.
* `revision` - Indicates current revision number of the object as seen by NSX-T API server. This attribute can be useful for debugging.
* `firewall_sections` - (Optional) The list of firewall sections for this router

## Importing

An existing logical tier0 router can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource, via the following command:

[docs-import]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import

```shell
terraform import nsxt_logical_tier0_router.tier0_router UUID
```

The above command imports the logical tier 0 router named `tier0_router` with the NSX id `UUID`.
