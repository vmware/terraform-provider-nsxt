# nsxt_policy_service

This resource provides a way to configure a networking and security service which can be used within NSX Policy.

This resource is applicable to NSX Global Manager, NSX Policy Manager and VMC.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "nsxt_policy_service" "service_icmp" {
  description  = "ICMP service provisioned by Terraform"
  display_name = "S1"

  icmp_entry {
    display_name = "ICMP-entry"
    description  = "ICMP v4 entry"
    protocol     = "ICMPv4"
    icmp_code    = "1"
    icmp_type    = "3"
  }

  tag {
    scope = "color"
    tag   = "blue"
  }
}

resource "nsxt_policy_service" "service_l4port" {
  description  = "L4 ports service provisioned by Terraform"
  display_name = "S1"

  l4_port_set_entry {
    display_name      = "TCP80"
    description       = "TCP port 80 entry"
    protocol          = "TCP"
    destination_ports = ["80"]
  }

  tag {
    scope = "color"
    tag   = "pink"
  }
}
```

## Example Usage - Multi-Tenancy

```hcl
data "nsxt_policy_project" "demoproj" {
  display_name = "demoproj"
}

resource "nsxt_policy_service" "service_l4port" {
  context {
    project_id = data.nsxt_policy_project.demoproj.id
  }
  description  = "L4 ports service provisioned by Terraform"
  display_name = "S1"

  l4_port_set_entry {
    display_name      = "TCP80"
    description       = "TCP port 80 entry"
    protocol          = "TCP"
    destination_ports = ["80"]
  }

  tag {
    scope = "color"
    tag   = "pink"
  }
}
```

## Attributes Reference

In addition to arguments listed above, the following attributes are exported:

## Importing

An existing service can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource, via the following command:

[docs-import]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import

```shell
terraform import nsxt_policy_service.service_icmp ID
```

The above service imports the service named `service_icmp` with the NSX ID `ID`.

```shell
terraform import nsxt_policy_service.service_icmp POLICY_PATH
```

The above service imports the service named `service_icmp` with policy path `POLICY_PATH`.
Note: for multitenancy projects only the later form is usable.
