# nsxt_policy_tier0_gateway

This resource provides a method for the management of a Tier-0 gateway or VRF-Lite gateway.

This resource is applicable to NSX Global Manager and NSX Policy Manager.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "nsxt_policy_tier0_gateway" "tier0_gw" {
  description              = "Tier-0 provisioned by Terraform"
  display_name             = "Tier0-gw1"
  failover_mode            = "PREEMPTIVE"
  default_rule_logging     = false
  enable_firewall          = true
  ha_mode                  = "ACTIVE_STANDBY"
  internal_transit_subnets = ["102.64.0.0/16"]
  transit_subnets          = ["101.64.0.0/16"]
  vrf_transit_subnets      = ["100.64.0.0/16"]
  edge_cluster_path        = data.nsxt_policy_edge_cluster.EC.path
  rd_admin_address         = "192.168.0.2"

  bgp_config {
    local_as_num    = "60000"
    multipath_relax = false

    route_aggregation {

## Attributes Reference

In addition to arguments listed above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the Tier-0 gateway.
* `revision` - Indicates current revision number of the object as seen by NSX-T API server. This attribute can be useful for debugging.
* `path` - The NSX path of the policy resource.
* `bgp_config` - The following attributes are exported for `bgp_config`:
  * `revision` - Indicates current revision number of the object as seen by NSX-T API server. This attribute can be useful for debugging.
  * `path` - The NSX path of the policy resource.

## Importing

An existing policy Tier-0 gateway can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource, via the following command:

[docs-import]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import

```shell
terraform import nsxt_policy_tier0_gateway.tier0_gw ID
```

The above command imports the policy Tier-0 gateway named `tier0_gw` with the NSX Policy ID `ID`.

~> **NOTE:** When importing Gateway, `edge_cluster_path` will be assigned rather than `locale_service`. In order to switch to `locale_service` configuration, additional apply will be required.

~> **NOTE:** Redistribution config on Tier-0 resource is deprecated and thus will not be imported. Please import this configuration with `policy_gateway_redistribution_config` resource.
