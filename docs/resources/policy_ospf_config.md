# nsxt_policy_ospf_config

This resource provides a method for the management of OSPF for T0 Gateway on default locale service. A single resource should be specified per T0 Gateway. Edge Cluster is expected to be configured on the Gateway.

This resource is applicable to NSX Policy Manager only.
This resource is supported with NSX 3.1.1 onwards.

~> **NOTE:** NSX does not support deleting OSPF config on gateway, therefore this resource will update NSX object, but never delete it. To undo OSPF configuration, please disable it within the resource.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "nsxt_policy_ospf_config" "test" {
  gateway_path = nsxt_policy_tier0_gateway.gw1.path

  enabled               = true
  ecmp                  = true
  default_originate     = false
  graceful_restart_mode = "HELPER_ONLY"

  summary_address {
    prefix    = "20.1.0.0/24"
    advertise = false
  }
}
```
