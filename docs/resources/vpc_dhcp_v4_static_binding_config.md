# nsxt_vpc_dhcp_v4_static_binding

This resource provides a method for the management of a DhcpV4StaticBindingConfig.
This resource is applicable to NSX Policy Manager.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "nsxt_policy_project" "demoproj" {
  display_name = "demoproj"
}

data "nsxt_vpc" "demovpc" {
  context {
    project_id = data.nsxt_policy_project.demoproj.id
  }
  display_name = "vpc1"
}

data "nsxt_vpc_subnet" "test" {
  context {
    project_id = data.nsxt_policy_project.demoproj.id
    vpc_id     = data.nsxt_vpc.demovpc.id
  }
  display_name = "subnet1"
}

resource "nsxt_vpc_dhcp_v4_static_binding" "test" {
  parent_path     = data.nsxt_vpc_subnet.test.path
  display_name    = "test"
  description     = "Terraform provisioned DhcpV4StaticBindingConfig"
  gateway_address = "192.168.240.1"
  host_name       = "host.example.org"
  mac_address     = "10:0e:00:11:22:02"
  lease_time      = 162
  ip_address      = "192.168.240.41"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

## Attributes Reference

In addition to arguments listed above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the resource.
* `revision` - Indicates current revision number of the object as seen by NSX-T API server. This attribute can be useful for debugging.
* `path` - The NSX path of the policy resource.

## Importing

An existing object can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource, via the following command:

[docs-import]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import

```shell
terraform import nsxt_vpc_dhcp_v4_static_binding.test PATH
```

The above command imports DhcpV4StaticBindingConfig named `test` with the policy path `PATH`.
