## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `description` - (Optional) Description of this resource.
* `display_name` - (Optional) The display name of this resource. Defaults to ID if not set.
* `enabled` - (Optional) Whether the virtual server is enabled. Default is true.
* `ip_address` - (Required) Virtual server IP address.
* `port` - (Required) Virtual server port.
* `tag` - (Optional) A list of scope + tag pairs to associate with this lb http virtual server.
* `access_log_enabled` - (Optional) Whether access log is enabled. Default is false.
* `application_profile_id` - (Required) The application profile defines the application protocol characteristics.
* `default_pool_member_port` - (Optional) Default pool member port.
* `max_concurrent_connections` - (Optional) To ensure one virtual server does not over consume resources, affecting other applications hosted on the same LBS, connections to a virtual server can be capped. If it is not specified, it means that connections are unlimited.
* `max_new_connection_rate` - (Optional) To ensure one virtual server does not over consume resources, connections to a member can be rate limited. If it is not specified, it means that connection rate is unlimited.
* `persistence_profile_id` - (Optional) Persistence profile is used to allow related client connections to be sent to the same backend server.
* `pool_id` - (Optional) Pool of backend servers. Server pool consists of one or more servers, also referred to as pool members, that are similarly configured and are running the same application.
* `sorry_pool_id` - (Optional) When load balancer can not select a backend server to serve the request in default pool or pool in rules, the request would be served by sorry server pool.
* `rule_ids` - (Optional) List of load balancer rules that provide customization of load balancing behavior using match/action rules.
* `client_ssl` - (Optional) Client side SSL customization.
    * `client_ssl_profile_id` - (Required) Id of client SSL profile that defines reusable properties.
    * `default_certificate_id` - (Required) Id of certificate that will be used if the server does not host     multiple hostnames on the same IP address or if the client does not support SNI extension.
    * `certificate_chain_depth` - (Optional) Allowed depth of certificate chain. Default is 3.
    * `client_auth` - (Optional) Whether client authentication is mandatory. Default is false.
    * `ca_ids` - (Optional) List of CA certificate ids for client authentication.
    * `crl_ids` - (Optional) List of CRL certificate ids for client authentication.
    * `sni_certificate_ids` - (Optional) List of certificates to serve different hostnames.

* `server_ssl` - (Optional) Server side SSL customization.
    * `server_ssl_profile_id` - (Required) Id of server SSL profile that defines reusable properties.
    * `server_auth` - (Optional) Whether server authentication is needed. Default is False. If true, ca_ids should be provided.
    * `certificate_chain_depth` - (Optional) Allowed depth of certificate chain. Default is 3.
    * `client_certificate_id` - (Optional) Whether server authentication is required. Default is false.
    * `ca_ids` - (Optional) List of CA certificate ids for server authentication.
    * `crl_ids` - (Optional) List of CRL certificate ids for server authentication.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to arguments listed above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the lb http virtual server.
* `revision` - Indicates current revision number of the object as seen by NSX-T API server. This attribute can be useful for debugging.

## Importing

An existing lb http virtual server can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource, via the following command:

[docs-import]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import

```shell
terraform import nsxt_lb_http_virtual_server.lb_http_virtual_server UUID
```

The above would import the lb http virtual server named `lb_http_virtual_server` with the nsx id `UUID`
