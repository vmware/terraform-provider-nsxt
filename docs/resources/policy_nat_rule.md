# nsxt_policy_nat_rule

This resource provides a method for the management of a NAT Rule.

This resource is applicable to NSX Global Manager, NSX Policy Manager and VMC.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "nsxt_policy_nat_rule" "dnat1" {
  display_name          = "dnat_rule1"
  action                = "DNAT"
  source_networks       = ["9.1.1.1", "9.2.1.1"]
  destination_networks  = ["11.1.1.1"]
  translated_networks   = ["10.1.1.1"]
  gateway_path          = nsxt_policy_tier1_gateway.t1gateway.path
  logging               = false
  firewall_match        = "MATCH_INTERNAL_ADDRESS"
  policy_based_vpn_mode = "BYPASS"

  tag {
    scope = "color"
    tag   = "blue"
  }
}
```

## Example Usage - Multi-Tenancy

```hcl
data "nsxt_policy_project" "demoproj" {
  display_name = "demoproj"
}

resource "nsxt_policy_nat_rule" "dnat1" {
  context {
    project_id = data.nsxt_policy_project.demoproj.id
  }
  display_name          = "dnat_rule1"
  action                = "DNAT"
  source_networks       = ["9.1.1.1", "9.2.1.1"]
  destination_networks  = ["11.1.1.1"]
  translated_networks   = ["10.1.1.1"]
  gateway_path          = nsxt_policy_tier1_gateway.t1gateway.path
  logging               = false
  firewall_match        = "MATCH_INTERNAL_ADDRESS"
  policy_based_vpn_mode = "BYPASS"

  tag {
    scope = "color"
    tag   = "blue"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `display_name` - (Required) Display name of the resource.
* `description` - (Optional) Description of the resource.
* `tag` - (Optional) A list of scope + tag pairs to associate with this NAT Rule.
* `nsx_id` - (Optional) The NSX ID of this resource. If set, this ID will be used to create the policy resource.
* `context` - (Optional) The context which the object belongs to
  * `project_id` - (Required) The ID of the project which the object belongs to
* `gateway_path` - (Required) The NSX Policy path to the Tier0 or Tier1 Gateway for this NAT Rule.
* `action` - (Required) The action for the NAT Rule. One of `SNAT`, `DNAT`, `REFLEXIVE`, `NO_SNAT`, `NO_DNAT`, `NAT64`.
* `section` - (Optional) Nat type, one of `USER`, `DEFAULT`, `NAT64` and `SYSTEM`. If not provided, `USER` type will be assumed, unless action is `NAT64`, in which case type is also `NAT64`.
* `destination_networks` - (Optional) A list of destination network IP addresses or CIDR. If unspecified, the value will be `ANY`.
* `enabled` - (Optional) Enable/disable the Rule. Defaults to `true`.
* `firewall_match` - (Optional) Firewall match flag. One of `MATCH_EXTERNAL_ADDRESS`, `MATCH_INTERNAL_ADDRESS`, `BYPASS`.
* `logging` - (Optional) Enable/disable rule logging. Defaults to `false`.
* `rule_priority` - (Optional) The priority of the rule. Valid values between 0 to 2147483647. Defaults to `100`.
* `service` - (Optional) Policy path of Service on which the NAT rule will be applied.
* `source_networks` - (Optional) A list of source network IP addresses or CIDR. If unspecified, the value will be `ANY`.
* `translated_networks` - (Optional) A list of translated network IP addresses or CIDR.
* `translated_ports` - (Optional) Port number or port range. For use with `DNAT` action only.
* `scope` - (Optional) A list of paths to interfaces and/or labels where the NAT Rule is enforced.
* `policy_based_vpn_mode` - (Optional) Policy based VPN mode. One of `BYPASS`, `MATCH`. For use with `DNAT` and `NO_DNAT` actions only. Defaults to `BYPASS` when applicable. This argument is supported for NSX 4.0.0 and above.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to arguments listed above, the following attributes are exported:

* `revision` - Indicates current revision number of the object as seen by NSX-T API server. This attribute can be useful for debugging.
* `path` - The NSX path of the policy resource.

## Importing

An existing policy NAT Rule can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource, via the following command:

[docs-import]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import

```shell
terraform import nsxt_policy_nat_rule.rule1 GWID/ID/[NAT64]
```

The above command imports the policy NAT Rule named `rule1` for the NSX Tier0 or Tier1 Gateway `GWID` with the NSX Policy ID `ID`. `NAT64` as nat type should be specified only for NAT64 case, otherwise it should be omitted.

```shell
terraform import nsxt_policy_nat_rule.rule1 POLICY_PATH
```

The above command imports the policy NAT Rule named `rule1` for policy path `POLICY_PATH`.
Note: for multitenancy projects only the later form is usable.
