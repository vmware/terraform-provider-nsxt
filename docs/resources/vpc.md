# nsxt_vpc

This resource provides a method for the management of a VPC.

This resource is applicable to NSX Policy Manager.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "nsxt_vpc" "test" {
  context {
    project_id = "test_proj"
  }

  display_name = "test"
  description  = "Terraform provisioned VPC"

  private_ips = ["192.168.55.0/24"]
  short_id    = "vpc-tf"

  load_balancer_vpc_endpoint {
    enabled = false
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `display_name` - (Required) Display name of the resource.
* `description` - (Optional) Description of the resource.
* `tag` - (Optional) A list of scope + tag pairs to associate with this resource.
* `nsx_id` - (Optional) The NSX ID of this resource. If set, this ID will be used to create the resource.
* `private_ips` - (Optional) IP CIDRs to manage private IPv4 subnets.
* `vpc_service_profile` - (Optional) The path of the configuration profile of the VPC services.
* `load_balancer_vpc_endpoint` - (Optional) Configuration for Load Balancer Endpoint
  * `enabled` - (Optional) Flag to indicate whether support for load balancing is needed. Setting this flag to `true` causes allocation of private IPs from the private block associated with this VPC for the use of the load balancer.
* `ip_address_type` - (Optional) This defines the IP address type that will be allocated for subnets.
* `short_id` - (Optional) Defaults to id if id is less than equal to 8 characters or defaults to random generated id if not set. Can not be updated once VPC is created.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - ID of the resource.
* `revision` - Indicates current revision number of the object as seen by NSX-T API server. This attribute can be useful for debugging.
* `path` - The NSX path of the policy resource.
* `private_ipv4_blocks` - (Optional) Policy paths of automatically created private IPv4 blocks, based on `private_ips` specified for the VPC.

An existing object can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource, via the following command:

```shell
terraform import nsxt_vpc.test PATH
```

The above command imports VOC named `test` with the NSX path `PATH`.
