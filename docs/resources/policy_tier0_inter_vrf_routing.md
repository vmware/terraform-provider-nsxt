# nsxt_policy_tier0_inter_vrf_routing

This resource provides a method for the management of tier0 inter VRF routing.
This resource is supported with NSX 4.1.0 onwards.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "nsxt_policy_tier0_inter_vrf_routing" "test" {
  display_name = "test-vrf-route"
  gateway_path = nsxt_policy_tier0_gateway.t0.path
  target_path  = nsxt_policy_tier0_gateway.t0-vrf.path

  bgp_route_leaking {
    address_family = "IPV4"
  }
  static_route_advertisement {
    advertisement_rule {
      name                      = "test"
      action                    = "PERMIT"
      prefix_operator           = "GE"
      route_advertisement_types = ["TIER0_CONNECTED", "TIER0_NAT"]
      subnets                   = ["192.168.240.0/24", "192.168.241.0/24"]
    }
    in_filter_prefix_list = [
      join("/", [nsxt_policy_tier0_gateway.parent.path, "prefix-lists/IPSEC_LOCAL_IP"]),
      join("/", [nsxt_policy_tier0_gateway.parent.path, "prefix-lists/DNS_FORWARDER_IP"])
    ]
  }
}
```

## Attributes Reference

In addition to arguments listed above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the resource.
* `revision` - Indicates current revision number of the object as seen by NSX-T API server. This attribute can be useful for debugging.

## Importing

An existing tier0 inter VRF routing configuration can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource, via the following command:

[docs-import]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import

```shell
terraform import nsxt_policy_tier0_inter_vrf_routing.vrfroute POLICY_PATH
```

The above command imports the policy tier0 inter VRF routing configuration named `vrfroute` for policy path `POLICY_PATH`.
