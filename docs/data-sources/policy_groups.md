# nsxt_policy_groups

This data source builds a "name to paths" map of the whole policy Groups table. Such map can be referenced in configuration to obtain object identifier attributes by display name at a cost of single roundtrip to NSX, which improves apply and refresh
time at scale, compared to multiple instances of `nsxt_policy_group` data source.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "nsxt_policy_groups" "map" {
}

resource "nsxt_policy_predefined_security_policy" "test" {
  path = data.nsxt_policy_security_policy.default_l3.path

  tag {
    scope = "color"
    tag   = "orange"
  }

  rule {
    display_name       = "allow_icmp"
    destination_groups = [data.nsxt_policy_groups.items["Cats"], data.nsxt_policy_groups.items["Dogs"]]
    action             = "ALLOW"
    services           = [nsxt_policy_service.icmp.path]
    logged             = true
  }

  rule {
    display_name     = "allow_udp"
    source_groups    = [data.nsxt_policy_groups.items["Fish"]]
    sources_excluded = true
    scope            = [data.nsxt_policy_groups.items["Aquarium"]]
    action           = "ALLOW"
    services         = [nsxt_policy_service.udp.path]
    logged           = true
    disabled         = true
  }

  default_rule {
    action = "DROP"
  }

}
```
