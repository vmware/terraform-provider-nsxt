# nsxt_policy_services

This data source builds a "name to policy path" map of the whole policy Services table. Such map can be referenced in configuration to obtain object identifier attributes by display name at a cost of single roundtrip to NSX, which improves apply and refresh
time at scale, compared to multiple instances of `nsxt_policy_service` data source.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "nsxt_policy_services" "map" {
}

resource "nsxt_policy_nat_rule" "dnat1" {
  display_name          = "dnat_rule1"
  action                = "DNAT"
  source_networks       = ["9.1.1.1", "9.2.1.1"]
  destination_networks  = ["11.1.1.1"]
  translated_networks   = ["10.1.1.1"]
  gateway_path          = nsxt_policy_tier1_gateway.t1gateway.path
  logging               = false
  firewall_match        = "MATCH_INTERNAL_ADDRESS"
  policy_based_vpn_mode = "BYPASS"
  service               = data.nsxt_policy_services.map.items["DNS-UDP"]

  tag {
    scope = "color"
    tag   = "blue"
  }
}
```
