# nsxt_policy_vms

This data source provides map of all Policy based Virtual Machines (VMs) listed in NSX inventory, and allows look-up of the VM by `display_name` in the map. Value of the map would provide one of VM ID types, according to `value_type` argument.

This data source is applicable to NSX Policy Manager and VMC.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "nsxt_policy_vms" "all" {
  state      = "running"
  guest_os   = "ubuntu"
  value_type = "bios_id"
}

resource "nsxt_policy_vm_tags" "test" {
  instance_id = data.nsxt_policy_vms.all.items["vm-1"]

  tag {
    scope = "color"
    tag   = "blue"
  }
}
```

## Example Usage - Multi-Tenancy

```hcl
data "nsxt_policy_project" "demoproj" {
  display_name = "demoproj"
}

data "nsxt_policy_vms" "all" {
  context {
    project_id = data.nsxt_policy_project.demoproj.id
  }
  state      = "running"
  guest_os   = "ubuntu"
  value_type = "bios_id"
}

resource "nsxt_policy_vm_tags" "test" {
  context {
    project_id = data.nsxt_policy_project.demoproj.id
  }
  instance_id = data.nsxt_policy_vms.all.items["vm-1"]

  tag {
    scope = "color"
    tag   = "blue"
  }
}
```
