# nsxt_policy_host_transport_node_profile

This resource provides a method for the management of a Policy Host Transport Node Profile.
This resource is supported with NSX 4.1.0 onwards.

**NOTE:** In case that the `nsxt_policy_host_transport_node_profile` is created in the same plan with `nsxt_compute_manager`, it is required to add a dependency between the two.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "nsxt_policy_host_transport_node_profile" "test" {
  display_name = "test_policy_host_tnp"

  standard_host_switch {
    ip_assignment {
      assigned_by_dhcp = true
    }
    transport_zone_endpoint {
      transport_zone = data.nsxt_policy_transport_zone.tz1.path
    }
    uplink_profile   = nsxt_policy_uplink_host_switch_profile.hsw_profile1.path
    is_migrate_pnics = false
    pnic {
      device_name = "fp-eth0"
      uplink_name = "uplink1"
    }
  }
}
```

## Importing

An existing policy Host Transport Node profile can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource, via the following command:

[docs-import]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import

```shell
terraform import nsxt_policy_host_transport_node_profile.test POLICY_PATH
```

The above command imports Policy Host Transport Node Profile named `test` with NSX policy path `POLICY_PATH`.
