This resource provides a method for the management of a Compute Manager.
This resource is supported with NSX 4.1.0 onwards.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "nsxt_compute_manager" "test" {
  description  = "Terraform provisioned Compute Manager"
  display_name = "test"
  tag {
    scope = "scope1"
    tag   = "tag1"
  }

  server = "192.168.244.144"

  credential {
    username_password_login {
      username = "user"
      password = "pass"
    }
  }
  origin_type = "vCenter"
}
```

## Attributes Reference

In addition to arguments listed above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the resource.
* `revision` - Indicates current revision number of the object as seen by NSX-T API server. This attribute can be useful for debugging.

## Importing

An existing Compute Manager can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource, via the following command:

[docs-import]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import

```shell
terraform import nsxt_compute_manager.test UUID
```

The above command imports Compute Manager named `test` with the NSX Compute Manager ID `UUID`.
