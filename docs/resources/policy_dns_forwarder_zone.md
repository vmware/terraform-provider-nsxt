[docs-import]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import

```shell
terraform import nsxt_policy_dns_forwarder_zone.test UUID
```

The above command imports PolicyDnsForwarderZone named `test` with the NSX Dns Forwarder Zone ID `UUID`.

```shell
terraform import nsxt_policy_dns_forwarder_zone.test POLICY_PATH
```

The above command imports PolicyDnsForwarderZone named `test` with the NSX Dns Forwarder Zone policy path `POLICY_PATH`.
Note: for multitenancy projects only the later form is usable.
