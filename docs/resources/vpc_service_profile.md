# nsxt_vpc_service_profile

This resource provides a method for the management of a VPC Service Profile.

This resource is applicable to NSX Policy Manager and is supported with NSX 9.0.0 onwards.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "nsxt_policy_project" "demoproj" {
  display_name = "demoproj"
}

resource "nsxt_vpc_service_profile" "vpc1_service_profile" {
  context {
    project_id = data.nsxt_policy_project.demoproj.id
  }

  display_name = "vpc1"
  description  = "Terraform provisioned Vpc Service Profile"

  mac_discovery_profile = nsxt_policy_mac_discovery_profile.for_vpc1.path
  spoof_guard_profile   = nsxt_policy_spoof_guard_profile.for_vpc1.path
  ip_discovery_profile  = nsxt_policy_ip_discovery_profile.for_vpc1.path
  qos_profile           = nsxt_policy_qos_profile.for_vpc1.path

  dhcp_config {
    dhcp_server_config {
      ntp_servers = ["20.2.60.5"]
      lease_time  = 50840

      dns_client_config {
        dns_server_ips = ["10.204.2.20"]
      }

      advanced_config {
        is_distributed_dhcp = false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `display_name` - (Required) Display name of the resource.
* `description` - (Optional) Description of the resource.
* `tag` - (Optional) A list of scope + tag pairs to associate with this resource.
* `nsx_id` - (Optional) The NSX ID of this resource. If set, this ID will be used to create the resource.
* `context` - (Required) The context which the object belongs to
    * `project_id` - (Required) The ID of the project which the object belongs to
* `mac_discovery_profile` - (Optional) Policy path for Mac Discovery Profile
* `spoof_guard_profile` - (Optional) Policy path for Spoof Guard Profile
* `ip_discovery_profile` - (Optional) Policy path for IP Discovery Profile
* `security_profile` - (Optional) Policy path for Security Profile
* `qos_profile` - (Optional) Policy path for QoS profile
* `dhcp_config` - (Required) DHCP configuration for this profile
    * `dhcp_server_config` - (Optional) DHCP server configuration for this profile
        * `ntp_servers` - (Optional) List of NTP servers
        * `dns_client_config` - (Optional) DNS Client configuration
            * `dns_server_ips` - (Optional) List of IP addresses of the DNS servers which need to be configured on the workload VMs
        * `lease_time` - (Optional) DHCP lease time in seconds.
        * `advanced_config` - (Optional) VPC DHCP advanced configuration
            * `is_distributed_dhcp` - DHCP server's IP allocation model based on workloads subnet port id. Can be `false` only when Edge cluster is available, in
        which case edge cluster in VPC connectivity profile must be configured. This is the traditional DHCP server that dynamically allocates IP per VM's MAC.
        If value is `true`, edge cluster will not be required. This is a DHCP server that dynamically assigns IP per VM port.
    * `dhcp_relay_config` - (Optional) DHCP Relay configuration
        * `server_addresses` - (Optional) List of DHCP server IP addresses for DHCP relay configuration. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to arguments listed above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the resource.
* `revision` - Indicates current revision number of the object as seen by NSX-T API server. This attribute can be useful for debugging.
* `path` - The NSX path of the policy resource.

## Importing

An existing object can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource, via the following command:

[docs-import]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import

```shell
terraform import nsxt_vpc_service_profile.test PATH
```

The above command imports VPC Service Profile named `test` with the NSX policy path `PATH`.
