# nsxt_upgrade_run

This resource provides a method to configure and execute upgrade of NSXT edges, hosts, and managers.

It will first configure upgrade unit groups and upgrade plan settings for `EDGE`
and `HOST` components. Then it will execute the upgrade for each component. If
there are either `EDGE` or `HOST` groups disabled from the upgrade, the corresponding
component will be paused after enabled groups get upgraded. At the same time, `MP` upgrade
won't be processed, because that requires `EDGE` and `HOST` to be fully upgraded. Refer to
the exposed attribute for current upgrade state details. For example, check `upgrade_plan`
for current upgrade plan, which also includes the plan not specified in this resource and
`state` for upgrade status of each component and UpgradeUnitGroups in the component. For more
details, please check NSX admin guide.

If upgrade post-checks are configured to be run, it will trigger the upgrade post-check.
Please use data source `nsxt_upgrade_postcheck` to retrieve results of upgrade post-checks.

**NOTE:** For details concerning specific NSX version, and limitations concerning supported scenarios and limitations, please review the [NSX upgrade guide](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/nsx/vmware-nsx/4-2/upgrade-guide/nsx-t-upgrade-guide.html).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "nsxt_upgrade_run" "run1" {
  upgrade_prepare_ready_id = nsxt_upgrade_prepare_ready.test.id

  edge_group {
    id      = data.nsxt_edge_upgrade_group.eg1.id
    enabled = false
  }

  edge_group {
    id      = data.nsxt_edge_upgrade_group.eg2.id
    enabled = true
  }

  host_group {
    id       = data.nsxt_host_upgrade_group.hg1.id
    parallel = true
  }
  host_group {
    display_name = "TEST123"
    parallel     = false
    hosts        = ["2fa96cdc-6b82-4284-a69a-18a21a6b6d0c"]
  }

  edge_upgrade_setting {
    parallel           = true
    post_upgrade_check = true
  }

  host_upgrade_setting {
    parallel           = true
    post_upgrade_check = true
  }
}
```
