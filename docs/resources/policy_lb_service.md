# nsxt_policy_lb_service

This resource provides a method for the management of a Load Balancer Service.

This resource is applicable to NSX Policy Manager.

In order to enforce correct order of create/delete, it is recommended to add
depends_on clause to lb service.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "nsxt_policy_tier1_gateway" "test" {
  display_name = "test"
}


resource "nsxt_policy_lb_service" "test" {
  display_name      = "test"
  description       = "Terraform provisioned Service"
  connectivity_path = data.nsxt_policy_tier1_gateway.test.path
  size              = "SMALL"
  enabled           = true
  error_log_level   = "ERROR"
  depends_on        = [nsxt_policy_tier1_gateway_interface.tier1_gateway_interface]
}
```
