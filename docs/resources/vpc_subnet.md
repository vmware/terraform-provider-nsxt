# nsxt_vpc_subnet

This resource provides a method for the management of a Vpc Subnet.

This resource is applicable to NSX Policy Manager.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "nsxt_policy_project" "demoproj" {
  display_name = "demoproj"
}

data "nsxt_vpc" "demovpc" {
  context {
    project_id = data.nsxt_policy_project.demoproj.id
  }
  display_name = "vpc1"
}


resource "nsxt_vpc_subnet" "test" {
  context {
    project_id = data.nsxt_policy_project.demoproj.id
    vpc_id     = data.nsxt_vpc.demovpc.id
  }

  display_name     = "test-subnet"
  description      = "Test VPC subnet"
  ipv4_subnet_size = 32
  ip_addresses     = ["192.168.240.0/24"]
  access_mode      = "Isolated"
}
```

~> **NOTE:** In some cases, subnet creation will depend on VPC attachment. If both resources are being created within same apply,
  explicit `depends_on` meta argument needs to be added to enforce this dependency.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `display_name` - (Required) Display name of the resource.
* `description` - (Optional) Description of the resource.
* `tag` - (Optional) A list of scope + tag pairs to associate with this resource.
* `nsx_id` - (Optional) The NSX ID of this resource. If set, this ID will be used to create the resource.
* `ipv4_subnet_size` - (Optional) If IP Addresses are not provided, this field will be used to carve out the ips
  from respective ip block defined in the parent VPC. The default is 64.
* `ip_addresses` - (Optional) If not provided, Ip assignment will be done based on VPC CIDRs
* `access_mode` - (Optional) Subnet access mode, one of `Private`, `Public`, `Isolated` or `Private_TGW`. Default is `Private`
* `advanced_config` - (Optional) Advanced Configuration for the Subnet
  * `gateway_addresses` - (Optional) List of Gateway IP Addresses per address family, in CIDR format
  * `connectivity_state` - (Optional) Connectivity state for the subnet, one of `CONNECTED`, `DISCONNECTED`
  * `dhcp_server_addresses` - (Optional) List of DHCP server addresses per address family, in CIDR format
  * `static_ip_allocation` - (Optional) Static IP allocation configuration
    * `enabled` - (Optional) Enable ip and mac address allocation for VPC Subnet ports from static ip pool. To
          enable this,
          dhcp pool shall be empty and static ip pool shall own all available ip addresses.
  * `extra_configs` - (Optional) List of vendor specific configuration key/value pairs
    * `config_pair` - (Required)
      * `key` - (Required) key for vendor-specific configuration
      * `value` - (Required) value for vendor-specific configuration
* `dhcp_config` - (Optional) DHCP configuration block
  * `mode` - (Optional) The operational mode of DHCP within the subnet, can be one of `DHCP_SERVER`, `DHCP_RELAY`, `DHCP_DEACTIVATED`.
       Default is `DHCP_DEACTIVATED`
  * `dhcp_server_additional_config` - (Optional) Additional DHCP server config
    * `options` - (Optional) DHCPv4 options block
      * `option121` - (Optional) Specification for DHCP option 121
        * `static_route` - (Optional) Static route
          * `network` - (Optional) Destination network in CIDR format
          * `next_hop` - (Optional) IP Address for next hop of the route
        * `other` - (Optional) DHCP option in generic format
          * `code` - (Optional) Code of DHCP option
          * `values` - (Optional) List of values in string format
    * `reserved_ip_ranges` - (Optional) Specifies IP ranges that are reserved and excluded from being assigned by the DHCP server to clients.
         This is a list of IP ranges or IP addresses.
* `ip_blocks` - (Optional) List of IP block path for subnet IP allocation

## Attributes Reference

In addition to arguments listed above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the resource.
* `revision` - Indicates current revision number of the object as seen by NSX-T API server. This attribute can be useful
  for debugging.
* `path` - The NSX path of the policy resource.

## Importing

An existing object can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource, via the following command:

[docs-import]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import

```shell
terraform import nsxt_vpc_subnet.test PATH
```

The above command imports VpcSubnet named `test` with the policy path `PATH`.
